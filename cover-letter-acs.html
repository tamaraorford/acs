<p>Dear Ms Buchanan & Ms Berry,</p>


<p>I am a mature aged Bachelor Law/Economics student at University of Queensland.  I have spent the last 15 years raising a family, the last 10 conducting 3 private renovation projects on properties my partner and I have purchased.  I am intimately familiar with the client side processes of purchasing a home and the fear faced by many in navigating the most expensive purchase of a lifetime.</p>

<p>I have previously worked as a loan processor for 15 months and for 3 years as a dishwasher, barista and waitress.  I volunteered at Sisters Inside (an amazing feminst organisation that advocates for the collective interests of women in the criminal justice system), assisting with transport of children to vistations with mothers in prison and some minor clerical work. However, all of my work experience (outside of renovating), is at least 12 years in the past.</p>

<p>I have completed a one month internship with Highway Advocates - a boutique law firm specialising in heavy vehicle transport legislation.  I liaised with the web developer, provided website content and developed marketing and promotional stall  materials for the company's launch in the Brisbane Truck Show 2021.  Currently I am the AIBC (Australian Indonesian Business Council) Intern for 2022 - a position in which I provide social media, event management and membership drive support.  </p>

<p>I have a passion for real estate and empowering marginalised communities.  I am proficient in word, powerpoint and excel.  While I do not have any exposure to leap cloud, pexa or online lodging with titles I am a fast learner and am relatively tech savvy.  Maths is one of my strong suits and while I would not like a career as a data analyst I am confident that computing settlement figures will be within my capabilities.  I am able to relate to people of varying cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds and believe empowerment and reliable, quality customer service are the keys to successful client retention and word-of-mouth marketing.    </p>

<p>I have attached my transcript from Central Queensland University where I began studying law in 2018.  I then transferred to University of Queensland to a Bachelor Economics and progressed into Bachelor Law/Economics this semester.  I have not completed any law units since CQU and as such have not attached my UQ transcript but am happy to if needed.  </p>

<p>I am willing to undertake an unpaid internship in order to build my current law related work experience and prove my capabilities in the position.  I am interested in a career in conveyancing and am looking for steady employment throughout my degree and preferably somewhere where I might be able to stay on as a junior solicitor.  I am living in Ipswich but have my own reliable transport.  </p>

<p>I believe I could be a great fit for the position and given an opportunity to learn, an asset to your company.  I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
